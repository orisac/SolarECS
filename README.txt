Thank you for your interests in computational modeling of electrochemical stripping. "main.m" performs all fitting of the hybrid model to the experimental data, and modeling of various operation scenarios. "ESCData.mat" contains experimental data on ammonia concentration in each chamber and pH at different time points, as well as a vector describing experimental conditions. "sumSquaresNumericalInt.m" and "plotNumericalInt.m" contain the model formulation. "extrapolateNumericalInt.m" contains the model formulation extrapolated to a flow through configurations. To get scenario results relevant to a given location and season, variables must be manually changed in the scripts "weather.m", "SolarIrradiance.m", and "solarECSEconomics.m". "DRAMAlgorithm" and "SolarECSextrapolation" respectively contain the fitting and scenario modeling sections of "main.m" as seperate files.
